    <p>After the image has been acquired and pre-processed, the following step is the identification of players' heads in the frame. This is achived by approximating the contour and shape of players in the binary foreground image. The highest such point can be marked as the direct top of a players head. 
        This is essentially a classification problem where after detecting potential candidate points, the systems classifies them as head or non-head. Certain other body parts such as a raised arm could raise false positives which can be

    <p>Camera callibration is important as the system is using multiple cameras in order to recreate the 3D area of the court. This is vital in transforming the image coordinates from the head detection step to global coordinates that correspond to the dimensions of the court. </p>
