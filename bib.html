    <p>Paper on a system that detects and marks players on the court in real time. The system begins by attempting to detect positions of the players' heads and classifying them as true or false positives. They are then mapped to the 2D coordinates of the court by calibrating and reconstructing the layout of the court from mutliple camera angles.</p><br />
