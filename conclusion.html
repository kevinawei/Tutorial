    <h1>Conclusions</h1>






    <p>In terms of individual tasks, it seems like the systems that were discussed in the tutorial could be combined to create a system which could identify when baskets were scored as well as identify and track players on the court. The only thing missing from a fully automated scoring detection system would be continuous ball tracking which could be combined with player tracking to determine which player was responsible for scoring after a made basket has been detected. Other potential expansions could include more detailed ball tracking which analyzes the trajectory of the ball when it leaves a players hands, or information about how many players were near someone shooting the ball and how close they were in order to analyze the level of defense being played. There are probably countless more improvements that can be made to create an extremely robust and complete basketball tracking system, but there are already components in place to craft a very serviceable system.</p>
